# lifeexpectNCY is a project basically imported from kaggle for a inital base work
on top of it GUI is built using TKINTER and personal values like BMI, alcohol, HIV status is taken and merged with median values of other factors which affects life expectancy 
Other factors considering median values are ok since it is country specific
